	<h2 id="my-training">My training</h2>
<p>I wrote about my training and my level of confidence in finishing the marathon in a previous post. In brief, the marathon took place on 2nd of April. And I started training in January, so only 3 months, which is a pretty small amount of time. These are the distances that I covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in January I ran <strong>70 km</strong>. Lucky for me there were two races organized in a forest from the town I live in, Cluj. Even if the races had a pretty small distance, first one having only 7 km, and the second one 15 km, it was good that it got me started with running after all the Christmas holidays. And both being in the forest that was covered with snow was a pretty fun way to get started.</li>
  <li>in February I only ran <strong>50 km</strong>. I don’t what happened that I got that lazy. I mean running in a month just 8 kilometers more than you are supposed to run in the marathon it’s not a good plan. But it was a cold month and in my defence at least I did every two days a cross training at home. That included jumping the rope, crunches, squats and other similar exercises.</li>
  <li>in March I got scared and realized that I cannot continue the same. So I ran more than <strong>200 km</strong>. One long run of 35 km, another one of 30 km which got me both physically and mentally prepared, five runs of 15km and some other small distances runs. So after this month I knew I was ready to finish the marathon even if I was convinced that the time was not going to be something impressive. Also increasing the distance from 50km in a month to 200km the next month is not something recommended by anyone. But I was lucky to complete the training without and injury.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also having my girlfriend and two other friends as a training partners help me a lot. When I did the 30 and 35 kilometers runs I had to wake up 5:30 in the morning and run with temperatures below 0 degrees celsius. Not fun at all</p>

<h2 id="the-days-before-the-marathon">The days before the marathon</h2>
<p>We went 8 friends in Rome. Four of us running the marathon, the other four in a city break. We arrived on Friday, the race was on Sunday and on Monday we were returning to Cluj. On Saturday we picked up the race kit, visited Rome, which I enjoyed a lot. But vising Rome got me so tired that in the evening when I arrived at the hotel just 12 hours before the marathon my legs hurt from walking the city so much. I think we walked for like 20 km that day. Again, not recommended, everyone knows being rested in the race day is essential. The one thing that we did correctly however was the carbo-loading the day before the marathon. The pizza and the pasta were amazing.</p>

<h2 id="the-marathon">The marathon</h2>
<p>In the morning I woke up at 6:30 with the marathon starting at 9:00. I felt very good in the morning. The legs were a bit tired from the day before, but that didn’t affect my confidence in doing a good race at the start. The weather seemed to be good, cloudy with a maximum of 15 degrees being announced for that day. But right when the marathon started, after the Italian anthem was sang, it started raining. And it went like that for the first 10 km. I didn’t feel cold or anything, just concerned that I had my phone with me and is not waterproof (Galaxy S6). And the phone indeed stopped working correctly for two days, but after it recovered. Back to the marathon, from 10 km to 30 km it stopped raining and being cloudy and not too hot it was the perfect weather. But then, it started raining again through out the end of the race and it was not fun anymore. After the 30 km I started to feel tired, and after 35 km really exhausted. But I continued running, even if at a slower pace than before. Also it rained a lot and with all the wind I started feeling cold, which seems a bit unusual considering the long run. My hands were freezing. Every step was painful for the last 4 km. But we didin’t stop. And managed to finish the marathong in <strong>4h and 33m</strong>. I was more than happy in the end with the time as well, having in mind the inadequate training that I had.</p>

<p>Overall it was an awesome experience. I enjoedy both the training and the race. If I wouldn’t have signed up for the marathon I doubt that I would have done any exercises during the winter. Apart from playing tennis once a week for one hour which I’m doing now for the last two years. And of course after this marathon we were already discussing about the next one, so we signed up for the Bucharest marathon in October 2017.</p>
