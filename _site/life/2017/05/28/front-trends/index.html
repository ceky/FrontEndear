<p>I had the opportunity to be offered a ticket by the company I work for to go to the Front-Trends conference. This is one of the biggest conferences in the frontend development area, so I was happy to be there. I never visited Poland so being there from Monday to Friday was pretty awesome. During my stay there I visited:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the National museum, which had a lot of Polish and foreign paintings</li>
  <li>the Royal Castle that was destroyed by the Nazis during the WW2, being rebuild in the 70s</li>
  <li>Chopin Museum. But I have to say I was more impressed by the benches in the town that sang Chopin’s songs than by this museum</li>
  <li>Lazienki Park which is pretty big and awesome</li>
  <li>Vistula River beach full of young people, gave me the impression I was at the seaside with such a good weather that we had</li>
  <li>Old town was almost completely destroyed in the WW2 but it was rebuild and it looks really good</li>
  <li>walked a lot in the rest of the city, did some shopping in a mall from the city center</li>
</ul>

<p>I liked Warsaw a lot. The Old town and all the city center really looks like amazing, while the rest I found to be pretty similar to the cities from Romania. Some communist building here and there, looking good overall, but still you can see clearly that both countries still have room to develop comparing with some other Western European countries.</p>

<h2 id="front-trends">Front-Trends</h2>
<p>This was only the second conference I attended. First one being in Bucharest, organized by Adobe, long time ago when I was working with Flash and Flex. So I was pretty excited about the event. I was there with four other colleagues and took part to all the presentations from Wednesday and Thursday and only for the first two from Friday, since I had to return to run in the Carpathian mountains in Romania at a half marathon on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the conference. Most of the talks were really good. Few of them were boring. Either because the speakers seemed to not be able to animate the audience by presenting with a good vibe, either I was not really interested by the topics. But that is normal. With so many topics covered, the web development growing like crazy in the last years. So I would say about 70% of the talks got me really engaged in the presentations.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fronttrends2.jpg" alt="running" /></p>

<p>I knew some of the speakers from youtube, articles, tutorials or podcasts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Una Kravets</li>
  <li>Kirupa Chinnathambi</li>
  <li>Vitaly Friedman</li>
  <li>Val Head</li>
</ul>

<p>And was happy to discover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jack Franklin shared the way he and he’s team migrated a project from Angular to React</li>
  <li>Sam Bellen which had an interesing presentation about the browsers API</li>
  <li>Lin Clark got me more curious about her work and a bit less about the topic she presented since I didn’t work with React up until this point</li>
  <li>Konrad Dzwinel - I had no expectations about this talk since I know most of the things developer tools can do, but I enjoyed a lot the what he shared and the directions in which the dev tools can develop in the future</li>
  <li>Patrick Hamann was one of may favorites. I’m really into web performance lately, and even if I knew most of the stuff he shared, there were still some interesting things that got me craving to go more deep into some of the things</li>
  <li>Stefan Judis - didn’t know he was one of the creators of <a href="http://www.perf-tooling.today/" target="_blank">Perf Tooling</a>. Spoke about different types of the Observers, that I never used, but can’t wait to play with it</li>
  <li>Niels Leenheer probably the geekist speaker from this conference. Really enjoyable talk even if I’m not into the topics of devices</li>
  <li>Vadim Makeev presented about controlling devices from web browsers using bluetooth. Again not really my field of interest, but really funny</li>
  <li>Martin Splitt, what a dude. I’ve seen he was in my city (Cluj) before and it’s going to come again for JSHeroes conference. Since I’m really into performance optimization I was really entertained by this talk</li>
  <li>Ola Gasidlo, Rosie Campbell and Phil Hawksworth. Haven’t seen their talks on Friday since I had to leave earlier. But I’m gonna make sure to view them once they are uploaded on youtube. They were the hosts of the event in these there days and did an awesome job</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes from the conferences can be found <a href="https://github.com/nienkedekker/Front-Trends-2017" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/verlok/frontTrendsWarsaw2017" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>All in all was a really good event, organized very well, that left me curious about some topics I’ve seen there and I’m looking forward to dig into them soon. Hopefully this event will continue to be organized in the future and I’ll be healthy enough to take part once again in the years to come.</p>
