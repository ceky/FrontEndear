title: Solving the web performance crisis
description: A talk about optimizing website performance. Really liked the way you can make babel transpile ES2015 features not supported in specific browsers using babel-preset-env described in part 3. Also in part 5 of the presentation it described a situation that I got into at work on how to load critical css and js in the head.
