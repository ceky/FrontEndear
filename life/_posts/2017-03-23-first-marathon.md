## My running background
I was always into sports. I always enjoyed playing football. But since I injured myself and suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery I had to take it slow and play less and less. Apart from this I wasn't into any other sport. I always hated going to the gym. That was until 2014 when I started playing tennis once a week. I still take a one hour a week tennis class.

On February 2015 my then colleagues asked me to join them in a relay race. They were three and needed another person. Since I was playing football with them I said why not. Even if I never understood running and runners. Why would anyone run? I mean where is the challenge in putting effort where there is no score? The race was in April so I had two months of training for those 10.5 km. Running that much was looking incredible for me at the time. I managed to do it in the end in 55 minutes and felt so good running more than 6 km which was the most I ran while training for the race.

So before I knew I signed in for some other 10km races in my home town and in the city I live in. One year after my first race, on April 2016 I ran my first half marathon. Running for two hours without stopping. I was exhausted afterwards. I did train for two months, running once or twice a week. But it was not an easy race. I didn't imagine that I would ever ran more than that.

## Increasing the running distance
So after my first road half marathon I participated two months after that in another half marathon. This time a trail race in the mountains. I finished in 3 hours and 15 minutes. A difficult race but it had the best sights out of all the races. The landscape was just amazing. And since then I ran some more 10km races but nothing more.

On October 2016 I signed in with my girlfriend and two other friends for the Rome marathon. The marathon will take place on 2nd of April 2017. So even if I never ran a marathon before, 6 months looked like a good plan to train for running it. The problem is I didn't train at all for the first 3 months. I had to rest to recover from a knee injury, but I was also lazy cause I could do cycling or some other sort of cross training to help me put in shape.

So I started running on January when in total I ran 75 km. But then in February when I had to increase the distance I got lazy and ran only 52 km. Following a training plan for a marathon would require to run 52 km in a week not a month. And then on March I started to have nightmares with the marathon so I had to take it serious and respect the distance that I signed up for. So now on 23th of March I already have 165 km as a total distance. With less than two weeks before the marathon. I did two long runs, one of 30 km, the other last weekend (two weekes before the marathon) of 35 km. I felt awful after that. My legs hurt so much that I could barely walk in my house. But I had to do it. I might as well run another 30 km this weekend even if it might not be a good idea running that kind of a distance one week before the race.

## Ready to run the marathon?
So on the bad side I started training late and not doing it as I should only 6 weeks before the marathon. Of course I didn't start from scratch. On 29 of January I ran 18 km in a race in the forest. Also I continue playing tennis once a week. And in February even if I ran less I did some strength exercises at home like planks, crunches and squats. And then on March I ran like crazy. And now my knee hurts a bit. So I feel like I didn't train properly for this marathon, but I'm confident I can finish it. Of course the time won't be impressive, I just want to finish it in less than 5 hours. And then if I ever run a second marathon again I will train better and work on improving my running pace as well. During the training I run with an average of 5:40 minutes / km. During the marathon I plan to run slower so I can pass the finish line on my feet.

All in all I enjoyed training for the marathon and it's a good thing that it kept me motivated to stay fit during the winter, when it's so easy to find excuses to avoid training. So the journey for a marathon training is awesome, hopefully I will be able to enjoy the marathon as well.
